\title{Simulated Survival Data with Binary Treatment}
\format{
A data frame with 1000 observations and 8 variables:
\describe{
  \item{X1}{Continuous covariate (standard normal).}
  \item{X2}{Continuous covariate (standard normal).}
  \item{X3}{Continuous covariate (standard normal).}
  \item{B1}{Binary covariate (0/1).}
  \item{B2}{Binary covariate (0/1).}
  \item{Z}{Treatment group: "A" or "B". Distribution is approximately 40:60.}
  \item{time}{Observed follow-up time (event or censoring), range 0-20.}
  \item{event}{Event indicator: 1 = event observed, 0 = censored.}
}
}
\usage{
simdata_bin
}
\description{
A simulated dataset for demonstrating propensity score weighting methods
in survival analysis with a binary treatment.
}
\details{
The data were generated with the following characteristics:
\itemize{
  \item Treatment assignment depends on X1, X2, and B1 via logistic model.
  \item Survival times follow Weibull distributions with group-specific scales
    (group A has better survival than group B).
  \item Censoring times follow an exponential distribution depending on X1 and B1.
  \item Administrative censoring occurs at time 20.
  \item Overall censoring rate is approximately 30%.
