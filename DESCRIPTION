Description: Implements propensity score weighting methods for estimating
    counterfactual survival functions and marginal hazard ratios in
    observational studies with time-to-event outcomes. Supports binary and
    multiple treatment groups with average treatment effect on the combined
    full population (ATE), average treatment effect on the treated or target 
    group (ATT), and overlap weighting estimands. Includes symmetric (Crump) 
    and asymmetric (Sturmer) trimming options for extreme propensity scores. 
    Variance estimation via analytical M-estimation or bootstrap. 
    Methods based on Cheng et al. (2022) <doi:10.1093/aje/kwac043> and Li & 
    Li (2019) <doi:10.1214/19-AOAS1282>.
