\title{Simulated Survival Data with Multiple Treatments}
\format{
A data frame with 1000 observations and 8 variables:
\describe{
  \item{X1}{Continuous covariate (standard normal).}
  \item{X2}{Continuous covariate (standard normal).}
  \item{X3}{Continuous covariate (standard normal).}
  \item{B1}{Binary covariate (0/1).}
  \item{B2}{Binary covariate (0/1).}
  \item{Z}{Treatment group: "A", "B", "C", or "D". Distribution is approximately
    20:20:20:35.}
  \item{time}{Observed follow-up time (event or censoring), range 0-20.}
  \item{event}{Event indicator: 1 = event observed, 0 = censored.}
}
}
\usage{
simdata_multi
}
\description{
A simulated dataset for demonstrating propensity score weighting methods
in survival analysis with four treatment groups.
}
\details{
The data were generated with the following characteristics:
\itemize{
  \item Treatment assignment depends on X1, X2, X3, B1, and B2 via multinomial
    logistic model.
  \item Survival times follow Weibull distributions with group-specific scales.
    Survival ordering (best to worst): C > A > B > D.
  \item Censoring times follow an exponential distribution depending on X1 and B1.
  \item Administrative censoring occurs at time 20.
  \item Overall censoring rate is approximately 30%.
